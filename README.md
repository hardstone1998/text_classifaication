# Text Classification Exploration Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore various cutting-edge techniques and methods to perform text classification on a wide range of open-source text datasets. By conducting systematic experiments and comparisons across diverse text data, we strive to improve classification accuracy and generalization.

## Technical Exploration Areas
- **Embedding + Traditional Machine Learning**  
  Utilize word or sentence embeddings combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and other methods for text classification.

- **Large Pretrained Models + Prompt Engineering and LoRA Fine-tuning**  
  Leverage large-scale pretrained models with prompt engineering and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to enhance model performance on specific classification tasks.

- **BERT Training**  
  Train and fine-tune BERT models for improved text classification performance.

- **Custom Model Design from Scratch**  
  Design and implement custom deep learning models tailored to project requirements, exploring novel architectures and algorithms.

## Goals
- Achieve effective classification on various publicly available text datasets.
- Compare the effectiveness and suitability of different technical approaches.
- Explore best practices in model fine-tuning and custom model design.

## Datasets
The project will utilize multiple public text classification datasets covering domains such as news, reviews, and Q&A.

## Usage
(To be supplemented based on actual project implementation, including installation, running instructions, and data preparation.)

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to help improve the project.
